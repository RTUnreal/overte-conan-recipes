      # Every Overte plugins fails to load due to:
      # `[hifi.plugins] Plugin hifiOsc.dll failed to load:`
      # `[hifi.plugins] The plugin 'C:/Users/jug00/CLionProjects/overte/build/interface/Release/plugins/hifiOsc.dll' uses incompatible Qt library. (Cannot mix debug and release libraries.)`
      # It seems to think that our release plugins are built as debug.
      # Debug builds don't suffer from this issue.
